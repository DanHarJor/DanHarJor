### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub. I have organised the final Jupyter-Notebooks from several of my most interesting projects into one repo.  
  
https://github.com/DanHarJor/InterestingDataScienceProjects

### Python
Most of my coding experience is in Python. It is the main language we used in UNIPD Physics of Data (2021-2023) and the language used in the interesting projects repo.  

The main libraries used are: 
- Tensorflow
- Pytorch
- Optuna Hyper Parameter Tuning
- Dask Parallelization

### Java

I also have some experience in Java. I first used it in a class called Models of Physical Phenomena back in 2016 at the University of Liverpool. We used it to track particle trajectories in the LHC. We were given data on the initial position, momentum and mass of each particle. We also had data on the external magnetic field. The main goal was to find the mass of the Higgs Boson. Unfortunately, I didn't have git at this time and I don't have the code any more.

I did another Java project in Physics of Data at UNIPD. I took a class called Information Retrieval where I had to create a novel approach to a search engine. We used [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/) and its core modules to create a basic bag of word pipeline. Then we experimented with using Wikipedia's public list of page titles to decipher if some consecutive words have a single meaning. For example, New and York are two words with one meaning when written together. The system should link them together to provide better search results. The repo is in [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/dan-har-jor/seupd2122-ist-before-final-clean/src/master/), feel free to check it out.

### C++
C++ is the obvious choice for speed but it has also found a niche in Arduino microcontrollers. I learnt some C++ in order to develop my Arduino controlled medication dispension system. It is used to control a stepper motor that turns a tray of compartments towards an opening in the device. C++ also manages serial communication with a Python GUI that can program the device to dispense at the appropriate time. I think an impenetrable version of the device would be useful for care workers who have patients that must take addictive medication. It could also be useful for smokers to manage their daily tobacco dose when trying to quit. Here is a link to my [DrugBox](https://github.com/DanHarJor/DrugBox) code.
